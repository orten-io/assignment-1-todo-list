# Todo list

You're going to make a todo list according to the provided design. The user should be able to:
- Add a task to the list
- See the added tasks
- Be able to clear all items

## Assets

Colors:

- Background grey/blue: `#475E67`
- Add button green: `#31D500`
- "Clear all" text red: `#C75959`
- Borders & "Add another task" placeholder grey: `#95989A`

**Font**: "Arial, sans-serif"

## Want an extra challenge?

Here are some things you can do if you feel interested and have time left:

- Display a message informing the user that they have nothing to do (when there are no tasks ofc)
- Make it responsive! Adapt it to both mobile and desktop, and make it look good on both
- Allow the user to remove individual tasks (add a delete button by each task)
- Make it smooooooth by adding some animations, i.e. when the user adds a task and clears the list
